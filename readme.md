# libgfapi-jni

Java Native Interface (JNI) bindings for libgfapi, the GlusterFS client API.

# instructions

## groundwork

### Prerequisites

* gluster 3.4 or newer - installed from source or a gluster development package installed.
* maven 3.0.3 or newer
* auto tool chain

## Compiling without tests

If you have installed gluster to non-standard location then you export `GLFS_HOME` so we know where it's at:

    export GLFS_HOME=/path/to/gluster/prefix

Building without tests is simple.  Just run:

    mvn -Pdownlaod -Plinux64 -Dmaven.test.skip=true install

## Compiling and Testing

To really test this you'll need a running glusterfs volume called *foo*.

- Set up a loopback interface alias, because glusterfs refuses to create a volume with a brick on *localhost* or *127.0.0.1*

        ifconfig lo:0 127.0.2.1

- Create a glusterfs volume called *foo*

        gluster volume create foo 127.0.2.1:/var/tmp/foo
        gluster volume start foo

- Gluster requires that clients communicate from privileged source ports, so we need to build and test with sudo.  You also need to 
make sure that the gluster libs are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

        sudo bash
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GLUSTER_PREFIX}/lib
        mvn -Pdownlaod -Plinux64 install

- If successful, the test will have created a file called *bar* in the volume, and written *hello world* into it.

        ls -la /var/tmp/foo
        cat /var/tmp/foo/bar

- There should also be a log file generated by libgfapi in the test program, check it out

        cat glfsjni/glfsjni-linux64/target/glfsjni.log
